# B#CKR##MS R#N#W#D
A new Backrooms mod for Lethal Company, with many innovations.

## 📜 Explanation
This mod is **not an interior** mod, it does not add new interior and **scrap does not spawn in the Backrooms**.  
What it does is different. It adds parallel place, **The Backrooms**, where you can be teleported when you're about to die, when you take damages (very small chance) or when you clip through a wall or through the floor.  
  
## ✨ Features
Here is a non-exhaustive list of features. Some will remain hidden as they're meant to be discovered by chance.
- **Procedurally generated Backrooms**: Pick between 5 generation algorithms for different backrooms designs and difficulties. Each cell/tile of the backrooms has many variants, some of them have specific features, easter eggs, etc.
- **Situational TP**: Teleport in the backrooms when about to die (5% chance by default), when taking damages (0.1% chance by default), or when clipping through a wall or through the floor (100% chance by default)
- **Correctly setup NavMesh**: For those who know what it means, you can guess what comes with that.
- **Random stuff hidden in the Backrooms**: Mostly stuff I wanted to put there for fun or for the lore or ambience. Honestly it depends.

## 🔩 Settings
- `Streamer Mode`: It's not because of any gore content, it's just because sometimes, the Backrooms can have speakers that broadcast music which can be occasionally copyrighted. It replaces the copyrighted musics with copyright-free musics.
- `Use Fair Randomizer`: Whether to use a fair randomizer (a.k.a. pity system in gacha games) or a normal random number generator for random events (e.g. Teleports)
- `Teleport On Death`: If enabled, player can be teleported to the backrooms with a certain % of chance.
- `TP Odds On Death`: The % of chance to get TP to the backrooms when dying (see TP on Death)
- `Teleport On Clipping`: If enabled, players will be teleported to the backrooms when clipping through the walls or floor. Yeah it can happen.
- `TP Odds On Clipping`: //
- `Teleport On Damage`: If enabled, player can be teleported when receiving damages, with a certain % of chance.
- `TP Odds On Damage`: //
- `Drop Held Items`: If enabled, will drop all the items on the ground when getting TP'd to the backrooms. 
- `Generation Algorithm`: The generation algorithm for the backrooms. Doesn't require a restart, but will only apply the next round.
    - `Blob` (default): Blob Algorithm is the algorithm that pictures the best the feeling of the Backrooms, with rooms and corridors. It also is a perfect balance between generation speed and difficulty.
    - `Kruskal`: Kruskal Algorithm gives a more maze-ish style, while still having a lot of interconnections. It is very fast at generation and quite easy to navigate through.
    - `Prim`: Prim Algorithm is really a maze. It has a moderate generation speed and can be difficult to navigate through.
    - `Wilson`: Wilson Algorithm is the most difficult one. It has a moderate generation speed and is very difficult to go through, it's a real maze, compared to the others.
    - `Random Path Merge`: [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Random Path Merge algorithm is similar to Kruskal but can occasionally generate rooms. It's one of the fourth fastest algorithm after Fractal Tesselation, Blob and Kruskal algorithms, and it's quite easy to navigate through.
    - `Fractal Tesselation`: [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Fractal Tesselation algorithm is very unique: It will give a real feeling of déjà-vu while still having differences when navigating through. It's the fastest algorithm because of how it works.
- `Min Backroom Size`: The minimum backroom size (width and length) **in tiles**. 1 tile is 8 meters. Recommended size is 20 (default)
- `Max Backroom Size`: It's not fun to have too small backrooms, so it's better to keep it around 40-50.
- `Max Fake Exits Count`: Sets how many fake exits shall spawn in the backrooms. Fake exits don't kill you, they teleport you somewhere else in the backrooms.
