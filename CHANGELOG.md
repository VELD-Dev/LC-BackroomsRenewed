# Changelog
Here are listed all the changes made in each update.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/LC-BackroomsRenewed/releases/tag/0.1.0) - 2026-01-
- Implemented customizable procedural backrooms generation with 4 algorithms.
- Implemented basic ways to get TP'd to the backrooms
- Added many settings to push to another level custom gameplay experience. Some settings are synchronizable and can be modified only by host during the game.
- Added bases for cells variants and Backrooms themes/levels (I'll decide later if we only keep 1 level of the backrooms at once or if we generate several backroom levels)
- Added ambience effects (networked twinkling lights) for more immersion
